    <h1>Idle Workers</h1>
    <h2>Definition:</h2>
    <p>
      People who are mainly working shit jobs for survival low pay, unmotivated, with shut down dreams.
      They have access to free wifi connection, and nothing is happening around, they are security guards, sales clerks, with no one coming and going constanly,
      yet they do not generally use the precious time to learn and get out of the curse of slavery.      
    </p>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>
    <p>
      Any job where the worker wants the time to fly by: is fundamentally broken.
      Why not automate them. Work is a major part of our life and therefore dictates our overall happiness.<br><br>
      
      How can we give these peeps leverage in doing something meaningful
      or learning something that gets them to actually have the ability to do meaningful work?
    </p>

    <h2>Potential Solution:</h2>
    <p>
        Activity Value Blocks. A block of activity that curation markets members could do.<br>
        For instance, Cent right right now has 2 AVBs: <br>

        * answering bounty questions<br>
        * ranking answers
